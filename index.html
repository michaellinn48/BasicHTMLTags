    <h2>Why all the hype?</h2>
    <p>Probably not, but you may be wondering what exactly made him a worldwide sensation.</p>
    <h4>Here are some reasons I came up with without actually thinking about it at all:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Very handsome</li>
        <li>Startling appearance</li>
        <li>Has range</li>
        <li>Styled hair</li>
    </ul>
